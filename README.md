Android Samples
================

Sometimes, when I'm reading through documentation, I want to put what I'm reading into practice to better understand it. So this is simply a repo I can use whenever I spin up a sample app to learn something new. Instead of making a million repos all over the place, this allows me to group sample apps together for easy reference, later.
